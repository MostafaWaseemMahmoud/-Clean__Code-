/*
---> Singly Linked List
------> Structure: Each node contains two fields: data and a link to the next node.
------> Traversal: Can only be traversed in one direction (forward).
------> Memory Usage: Uses less memory as each node only stores one pointer.
------> Operations: Insertion and deletion are simpler but can be less efficient for certain operations, such as deleting a node when only a reference to that node is given12.
---> Doubly Linked List
------> Structure: Each node contains three fields: data, a link to the next node, and a link to the previous node.
------> Traversal: Can be traversed in both directions (forward and backward).
------> Memory Usage: Uses more memory as each node stores two pointers.
------> Operations: More flexible and efficient for operations like insertion and deletion, especially when the node to be deleted is given12.
------> Key Differences
------> Memory: Singly linked lists use less memory compared to doubly linked lists.
------> Traversal: Singly linked lists allow traversal in one direction, while doubly linked lists allow traversal in both directions.
------> Complexity: Operations like deletion can be more complex in singly linked lists because you need to keep track of the previous node12.
